This was a project for my CS winter course at UNBSJ to program a JAVAFX game. I decided on a Fortnite battleship type game because my professor liked fortnite. 
I uploaded some of the files I was going to use as well to show how games have assets that they never use in the actual finished game. 
There is still some work to be done to the game to make it more appealing but it works, so that's very good.
